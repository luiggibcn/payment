# 🪑 Table Management — User Guide

## What can you do?

The table management module lets you view the dining room status in
real time and manage tables quickly: edit their configuration, merge
them, split them and reorganise the physical layout.

---

## Restaurant zones

At the top you will find the zone buttons:

> **Main Dining · Terrace · Outdoor**

Tap any of them to switch the view. Each zone has its own
independent layout.

---

## Table status

Each table displays a colour based on its current status:

| Colour | Status | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| 🔵 Blue | **Available** | Free, no occupants |
| 🟢 Green | **Reserved** | Reserved, waiting for guests to arrive |
| 🟠 Orange | **On Dine** | Occupied, with an active order |

The chair icons also change colour to reinforce the status visually.

## Edit a table ✏︎

To modify a table's details, tap the **✏︎** icon that appears in the
top-right corner of each table card.

A panel will open with the following options:

### Total seats
The number of physical chairs the table has. When you change it, the
preview inside the panel updates the chair icons instantly.

### Current occupants
The number of people currently seated. It cannot exceed the total
number of seats — the system adjusts it automatically if you enter
a higher value.

### Status
Switch the table status between **Available**, **Reserved** and
**On Dine**.

### Seat preview
While editing you will see the chair icons update in real time:
- 🟢 **Coloured chairs** → occupied
- ⚪ **Grey chairs** → available

Tap **Save** to apply the changes immediately on the floor plan.

## Merge tables

Useful when a large group needs several tables put together.

1. Tap **two or more tables** to select them
   (a ✓ appears in the corner of each selected table)
2. Tap the **⊕ Merge (n)** button that appears in the top toolbar
3. The tables are combined into one, with seats and occupants added
   together, labelled **"merged"**

> The resulting table status will be **On Dine** if any of the original
> tables had that status, or **Reserved** if any had a reservation.

---

## Split a table

Useful when a large table is physically separated into smaller ones.

1. Tap **one table** to select it
2. Tap the **⊗ Split** button in the top toolbar
3. Enter how many tables you want to split it into
4. The panel shows a **preview** with the table number and seats
   assigned to each resulting table
5. Tap **Split** to confirm

Seats are distributed evenly. If the number does not divide equally,
the first tables receive one extra seat.

> You can split any table, not only ones that have been previously
> merged. For example: a 6-seat table that is physically three
> 2-seat tables.

You can configure:
- Table **number**

The new table is placed automatically in the first available cell of
the active zone.
